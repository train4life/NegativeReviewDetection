# Project: Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

Overview:
Welcome to the Movie Review Sentiment Analysis project for the Film Junky Union! In this repository, you'll find the code and resources to build a model that automatically detects negative reviews from IMDB movie reviews. The project aims to classify reviews as positive or negative and achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85.

Objective:
The main objective of this project was to develop a sentiment analysis model that could accurately classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their content.

Step 1: Data Loading

Loaded the dataset of IMDB movie reviews with polarity labeling.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Preprocessed the data as necessary for analysis and modeling.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted EDA to analyze class imbalance and other patterns in the data.
Drew conclusions based on the EDA results.

Step 4: Data Preprocessing for Modeling

Preprocessed the data for modeling, which may include text vectorization and feature engineering.

Step 5: Model Training

Trained at least three different models using the provided training dataset.

Step 6: Model Testing

Tested the trained models using the provided test dataset.

Step 7: Self-generated Reviews Classification

Composed a few movie reviews and classify them using all the trained models.
Compared the classification results and explain any differences observed.

Step 8: Presenting Findings

Presented my findings, including EDA results, model performances, and differences in classification results.
Provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models.
